            <p>Near Block A, CCET(DG), Sector 26</p>
            <p>
                When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reacquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.
            </p>
            <p>Recommendation: Raspberry Italian soda</p>

                Note: This is another great place in the sector to try out. The baristas are friendly and the flavors are always worth exploring. The place is located at the end of the street, easily visible from the main road.
                 If you're looking for a refreshing drink and a nice atmosphere, this is the place to go.
